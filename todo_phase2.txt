ToDos:

Deduce the actual "e_range" for all the figures. 
	e_range = 0-0.1
	Maintain consistency in number of points in between 0-0.1
	VaR:
		No Efficient Frontier
		Only Chebyshev
		Tables

	CVaR:
		No effieicient frontier
		Run code for all p and generate tables.
		Find the best p and use the same.

2. Prepare eps colored files for both VaR and CVaR (for all combinations of market and simulated data) (Bilal ... by 5/4/2019)
3. Prepare tables for both VaR and CVaR (for all combinations of market and simulated data) (Shashank ... by 4/4/2019)

***Previous BTP corrections***


VaR: (Bilal)
1. Introduction (VaR as a risk measure why not std. deviation), VaR derivations (if any) ( ... by 7/4/2019)
2. Formulate the problem for both base case VaR and Worst Case VaR (only those whose experimental results are available) ( ... by 7/4/2019)
3. Any insights about the formulation. (Using separable uncertainty and why not others ... )
4. Experimental figs and tables 
5. Explain each of them like the last BTP Report.
6. Conclusions and Comments for a larger picture.


CVaR:

1. Introduction (CVaR as a risk measure and why not VaR), CVaR derivations (if any) ( ... by 7/4/2019)
2. Define coherent risk measures and Show that CVaR and WC-CVaR both are coherent risk measures. ( ... by 7/4/2019)
3. Formulate the problem for both base case CVaR and WC-CVaR (only those whose experimental results are available) ( ... by 7/4/2019)
4. Any insights on the formulation. (Using mixed uncertainty, why not others)
5. Experimental figs and tables
6. Explain each of them like the last BTP Report.
7. Conclusion and comments for a larger picture.

Last four points of VaR or CVaR should be completed in 13,14,15 April 2019


Abstract


Should be done by 15/4/19

==========================================================

Conclusions and Final say:

1. Are worst case versions are really improvising than those of base case counterparts?
	
	If No, what might be the reason?
	if Yes, What are the favourable conditions for this? Why those conditions are favourable?

	(Above two questions turn the whole report and are most important for future reference)

2. Pitch in a story to negate the Zhu paper.
3. Overall recommendation of Worst Case versions. (Since, no work has been done in this area, we can make a few powerful statements with evidences from previous chapters).

==========================================================

Should be submitted to Prof. SPC by 17/4/2019.
