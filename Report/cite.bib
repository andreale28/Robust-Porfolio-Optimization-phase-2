 abstract = {The indifference of many investment practitioners to mean-variance optimization technology, despite its theoretical appeal, is understandable in many cases. The major problem with MV optimization is its tendency to maximize the effects of errors in the input assumptions. Unconstrained MV optimization can yield results that are inferior to those of simple equal-weighting schemes. Nevertheless, MV optimization is superior to many ad hoc techniques in terms of integration of portfolio objectives with client constraints and efficient use of information. Its practical value may be enhanced by the sophisticated adjustment of inputs and the imposition of constraints based on fundamental investment considerations and the importance of priors. The operating principle should be that, to the extent that reliable information is available, it should be included as part of the definition of the optimization procedure.},

abstract="The mean-variance model for portfolio selection requires estimates of many parameters. This paper investigates the effect of errors in parameter estimates on the results of mean-variance analysis. Using a small amount of historical data to estimate parameters exposes the model to estimation errors. However, using a long time horizon to estimate parametes increasers the possibility of nonstationarity in the parameters. This paper investigates the tradeoff between estimation error and stationarity. A simulation study shows that the effects of estimation error can be surprisingly large. The magnitude of the errors increase with the number of securities in the analysis. Due to the error maximization property of mean-variance analysis, estimates of portfolio performance are optimistically biased predictors of actual portfolio performance. It is important for users of mean-variance analysis to recognize and correct for this phenomenon in order to develop more realistic expectations of the future performance of a portfolio. This paper suggests a method for adjusting for the bias. A statistical test is proposed to check for nonstationarity in historical data.",

 abstract = {This paper investigates the sensitivity of mean-variance (MV)-efficient portfolios to changes in the means of individual assets. When only a budget constraint is imposed on the investment problem, the analytical results indicate that an MV-efficient portfolio's weights, mean, and variance can be extremely sensitive to changes in asset means. When nonnegativity constraints are also imposed on the problem, the computational results confirm that a positively weighted MV-efficient portfolio's weights are extremely sensitive to changes in asset means, but the portfolio's returns are not. A surprisingly small increase in the mean of just one asset drives half the securities from the portfolio. Yet the portfolio's expected return and standard deviation are virtually unchanged.},

 abstract = {This paper shows how to perform sensitivity analysis for Mean-Variance (MV) portfolio problems using a general form of parametric quadratic programming. The analysis allows an investor to examine how parametric changes in either the means or the right-hand side of the constraints affect the composition, mean, and variance of the optimal portfolio. The optimal portfolio and associated multipliers are piecewise linear functions of the changes in either the means or the right-hand side of the constraints. The parametric parts of the solution show the rates of substitution of securities in the optimal portfolio, while the parametric parts of the multipliers show the rates at which constraints are either tightening or loosening. Furthermore, the parametric parts of the solution and multipliers change in different intervals when constraints become active or inactive. The optimal MV paths for sensitivity analyses are piecewise parabolic, as in traditional MV analysis. However, the optimal paths may contain negatively sloping segments and are characterized by types of kinks, i e., points of nondifferentiability, not found in MV analysis.},

abstract="The authors explore the negative effect that estimation error has on mean-variance optimal portfolios. It is shown that asset weights in mean-variance optimal portfolios are very sensitive to slight changes in input parameters. This instability is magnified by the presence of constrains that asset managers typically impose on their portfolios. The authors propose to use robust mean variance, a new technique which is based on robust optimisation, a deterministic framework designed to explicitly consider parameter uncertainty in optimisation problems. Alternative uncertainty regions that create a less conservative robust problem are introduced. In fact, the authors' proposed approach does not assume that all estimation errors will negatively affect the portfolios, as is the case in traditional robust optimisation, but rather that there are as many errors with negative consequences as there are errors with positive consequences. The authors demonstrate through extensive computational experiments that portfolios generated with their proposed robust mean variance methodolgy typically outperform traditional mean variance portfolios in a variety of investment scenarios. Additionally, robust mean variance portfolios are usually less sensitive to input parameters.",

abstract="Estimation error has always been acknowledged as a substantial problem in portfolio construction. Various approaches exist that range from Bayesian methods with a very strong rooting in decision theory to practitioner-based heuristics with no rooting in decision theory at all as portfolio resampling. Robust optimisation is the latest attempt to address estimation error directly in the portfolio construction process. It will be shown that robust optimisation is equivalent to Bayesian shrinkage estimators and offer no marginal value relative to the former. The implied shrinkage that comes with robust optimisation is difficult to control. Consistent with the ad hoc treatment of uncertainty aversion in robust optimisation, it can be seen that out of sample performance largely depends on the appropriate choice of uncertainty aversion, with no guideline on how to calibrate this parameter or how to make it consistent with the more well-known risk aversion.",

	abstract = {Robust optimization has been receiving increased attention in the recent few years due to the possibility of considering the problem of estimation error in the portfolio optimization problem. A question addressed so far by very few works is whether this approach is able to outperform traditional portfolio optimization techniques in terms of out-of-sample performance. Moreover, it is important to know whether this approach is able to deliver stable portfolio compositions over time, thus reducing management costs and facilitating practical implementation. We provide empirical evidence by assessing the out-of-sample performance and the stability of optimal portfolio compositions obtained with robust optimization and with traditional optimization techniques. The results indicated that, for simulated data, robust optimization performed better (both in terms of Sharpe ratios and portfolio turnover) than Markowitz's mean-variance portfolios and similarly to minimum-variance portfolios. The results for real market data indicated that the differences in risk-adjusted performance were not statistically different, but the portfolio compositions associated to robust optimization were more stable over time than traditional portfolio selection techniques.},

 abstract = {This note formulates a convex mathematical programming problem in which the usual definition of the feasible region is replaced by a significantly different strategy. Instead of specifying the feasible region by a set of convex inequalities, f<sub>i</sub>(x)≤ b<sub>i</sub>, i=1,2,⋯,m, the feasible region is defined via set containment. Here n convex activity sets {K<sub>j</sub>, j=1,2,⋯,n} and a convex resource set K are specified and the feasible region is given by <tex-math>$X=\{x \in R^{n}|x_{1}K_{1}+x_{2}K_{2}+\cdots +x_{n}K_{n}\subseteq K,\ x_{j}\geq 0\}$</tex-math>, where the binary operation + refers to addition of sets. The problem is then to find x̄∈ X that maximizes the linear function c· x. When the resource set has a special form, this problem is solved via an auxiliary linear-programming problem and application to inexact linear programming is possible.},

The ensuing optimization problem is called robust optimization. In this paper we lay the foundation of robust convex optimization. In the main part of the paper we show that if U is an ellipsoidal uncertainty set, then for some of the most important generic convex optimization problems (linear programming, quadratically constrained programming, semidefinite programming and others) the corresponding robust convex program is either exactly, or approximately, a tractable problem which lends itself to efficient algorithms such as polynomial time interior point methods.},
